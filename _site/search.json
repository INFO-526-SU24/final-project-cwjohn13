The quantity line graph will be split into each different type of pollutant removed (plastic bottles, polystyrene, etc.), these will be faded out in the background. The graph will also include 2 lines for recyclables and non-recyclables that will be highlighted, these will be cumulative quantities of recyclables and non-recyclables. The graph will have annotations showing when each major environmental movement ‘breakthrough’ occurred. This will show the effect quantity wise of these movements as well as if the movements shift pollutants from non-recyclables to more recyclables.\nMy second visualization will be a grouped bar chart grouping by recyclables versus non-recyclables. This bar chart will split the environmental movement’s breakthroughs up on the x-axis. For example, one of the ticks on the x-axis will be ‘IPCC Fifth Assessment Report’ which will include all data from the date 2014-10-31 through 2015-12-12. This will help us see which breakthrough, if any, had a large impact on quantities of pollutants removed from rivers."
