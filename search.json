I will split the types of pollutants into recyclables and non-recyclables to determine if the trend has shifted from more non-recyclables to more recyclable as a result of environment protect movements. I will also look into how each trash wheel’s pollutants have changed over time to see if different locations are effected differently by environment protection movements."
