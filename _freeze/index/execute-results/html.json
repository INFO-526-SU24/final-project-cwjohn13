Talk about the dataset\n\n## Question 1: How are environmental movements affecting the Trash Wheels collections located that the end of rivers?\n\n### Introduction\nFor this question I want to know the effects that environmental movements have on the pollutants that are being thrown into rivers where trash wheels are located. I would like to know if the amount of pollutants are decreasing and if the type of pollutants (recyclable versus non recyclable) are changing as a result of big environmental movements. I am interested in looking at this data because I have heard a ton of news over the last few years about environmental movements being more and more important and effective. I would like to know if all of these events actually change anything in peoples mind about pollutants or recyclables. \n\n\n### Approach\n\nI first cleaned the dataset, making sure there were no blank data values that could change the analysis.\n\n### Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis visualization shows pollutant quantities being pulled from the end of rivers by Trash Wheels overtime. The visualization also shows the dates in which major environmental movements began or had a change. From the visualization we can see the non-recyclable quantity decrease fairly steadily over the entire period looked at. This visualization also tells us that certain items such as plastic bottles saw no change in quantities polluted into rivers over this period. Although this visualization shows the trend of quantities of pollutant types over time, I would like to see more in=depth of how each movement effected the quantities of recyclables and non-recyclables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis visualization shows percentage of recyclable and non-recyclable pollutants in rivers following each environmental movement's occurrence. The visualization shows a direct comparison between recyclables and non-recyclable pollutants with percentage values of each which makes each environmental movements effect on types of pollutants very apparent. Although we see the same trend that was present in the prior visualization, the amount of non recyclables being greatly reduced over time, we also see something that wasn't very apparent in the last visualization. This visualization shows us that following the First National Cleanup Day, the percentage of non-recyclable pollutants actually increased in comparison to recyclable pollutants.\n\n\n### Discussion\n\nTalk about results here, what you gained from the graph\n\n",
