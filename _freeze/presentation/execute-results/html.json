Alongside this dataset, I included data regarding when the most prominent environmental movements took place over the last decade. By analysing visualizations made from these two datasets we will clearly see the effectiveness that environmental movements have on reducing pollutants and transfering pollutants from non recyclables to recyclables.\n\n## Question 1: How are environmental movements affecting the Trash Wheels collections located that the end of rivers?\n\n## Motivation for Question 1:\n\n-Through analysis of trends created by differing quantities of pollutants being removed by trash wheels alongside the timing of environmental movements, we will be able to determine if environmental movements actually benefit the quantities or types of pollutants being put into rivers.\n\n## General Quantity of Pollutants Removed by Trash Wheels from Rivers\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Quantity of Recyclables Removed From Rivers by TrashWheels\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Quantity of Non-Recyclables Removed From Rivers by TrashWheels\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Environmental Movement's Impact on Recyclables versus Non-Recyclables\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Insights Gained From the Visualizations\n\n-Steady Trend of pollutants moving from recyclables to non-recyclables.\n\n  -Environmental Movements are at least helping create more recyclables.\n  \n-Greta Thunberg's school strike movement helped lower quantities of pollutants in rivers\n\n-First National CleanUp Day seemed to actually negativly affect the quantity of recyclables versus non-recyclables.\n",
