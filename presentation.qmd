## Introduction to the Topic and Motivation

-how environmental movements effect river pollutants.
  
    -Based on pollutant removal by trash wheels

-With the increasing news surrounding big environmental movements I thought it would be interesting to see if any of these movements have been effective at reducing or changing the type of pollutants that are being found in rivers.

## Introduction to the Data

-trashwheel data set from tidyverse 

    -the amount of pollutants removed from rivers by trashwheels, Trash removal devices located at the end of rivers

-data regarding when the most prominent environmental movements took place over the last decade

## Question 1: How are environmental movements affecting the Trash Wheel's pollutant collections at the end of rivers?

-Pollutants being removed by trash wheels

-Timing of environmental movements

## General Quantity of Pollutants Removed by Trash Wheels from Rivers

```


## Insights Gained From the Visualizations

-Steady Trend of pollutants moving from non-recyclables to recyclables.

  -Environmental Movements are at least helping create more recyclables.
  
-Greta Thunberg's school strike movement helped lower quantities of pollutants in rivers

-First National Clean Up Day seemed to actually negatively affect the ratio of recyclables versus non-recyclables.
